Sorry the requested for sources of 1 process maybe lead the system to unsafe
So the system denied to assign sources to 1 process.
As you can see until now the available sources can not meet any need of process.
The system may execute only these processes:

after that the system involve in
unsafe status. If the sequence is null, meaning that no anyone process can be
execute if that request is successfully.
Back to before allocation:
